* Linux_hacks
small scripts and commands to make life easier
** watch_my_processes.sh
A script to log CPU and memory usage of processes.
The script uses 'ps' to find processes and writes the cpu
and memory usage of the most "heavy" commands to a file.
ATTENTION: The script uses an infite loop while logging. It has
to be aborted manually.
 
Default settings:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
USER=`whoami`
INTERVAL="30m"
LINES="10"
OUTPUT='load.log'
#+END_SRC
